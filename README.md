# About Me

I am a hobbiest programmer with a decent foundation in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, PHP, MySQL and microcontrollers, all of which I learned at school. In my spare time I teach myself Python. 

# My programming journey

Although I'm relatively inexperienced in the world of development, my interest in programming began in my youth when I created small programs, web pages and games. I know that the world of programming is vast and full of best practices. As I continue to develop my skills and work on my projects, I'm committed to learning and applying these principles. As I strive for excellence. I hope you'll understand that, as a learner, my projects reflect my ongoing journey in programming.

# Current Projects
I am currently working on a number of interesting projects. I have set a high standard for myself and my work, aiming to ensure that everything I publish reflects my commitment to learning and improving. While my projects may not yet meet the standards of experienced professionals, I only publish work that I believe demonstrates my current skills and potential for growth.

## My standards for public release
When considering a project for public release, I consider the following criteria:
- Clear documentation: The documentation should be easily understood, even by non-experts.
- User-friendly and accessible: The project should be easy to use for a wide range of users.
- Project Purpose: For me, it's also important to consider the purpose of the project and make sure it's not a waste of time. (And it's fun)
